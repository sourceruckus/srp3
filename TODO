* add --root flag (instead of DESTDIR or SRP_ROOT_PREFIX)

* finish implementing planned feature modules

* make sure we can pass options into --create, --build, --install

* query (from srp, brp, and installed manifest)

* exception handling clean up
**should we do this:
*** this one prints a good error message including the exception details, then prints a traceback when exception is re-raised

try:
    blarg
except Exception as e:
    print("bad things:", e)
    raise

**or this:
*** this one chains the exceptions together... which i don't really like

try:
    blarg
except Exception:
    raise Exception("bad things")
