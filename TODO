* move functions from bootstrap-early in here
Clean them up and make them available to build scripts

* hardcoded path to db file in srp.db

* cli additions [0/3]
  - [ ] --srcdir
  - [ ] --compressor=[gzip,bz2,lzma]
  - [ ] --compression-level=N
  - [ ] --root flag (instead of DESTDIR or SRP_ROOT_PREFIX)

* finish implementing planned feature modules [0/9]
  - [ ] core
  - [ ] size
  - [ ] upgrade
  - [ ] user
  - [ ] ldupdate
  - [ ] ldpath
  - [ ] repairable
  - [ ] strip_debug
  - [ ] strip_docs

* make sure we can pass options into --create, --build, --install

* get the --action stuff plumbed up.

* query (from srp, brp, and installed manifest)

* upgrade logic

* uninstall

* exception handling clean up
** should we do this:

*NOTE:* this one prints a good error message including the exception details,
        then prints a traceback when exception is re-raised

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
try:
    blarg
except Exception as e:
    print("bad things:", e)
    raise
#+END_EXAMPLE

** or this:

*NOTE:* this one chains the exceptions together... which i don't really like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
try:
    blarg
except Exception:
    raise Exception("bad things")
#+END_EXAMPLE


#  LocalWords:  flyspell cli srcdir gzip bz lzma ldupdate ldpath uninstall srp
#  LocalWords:  blarg hardcoded
