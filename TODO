planned features


## 2.4.*
- bug #023 (diskspace check)
- bug #068 (inplace cleanup)
- bug #036 (ldpath)
- bug #065 (checksuming special files)
- bug #069 (lchown symlinks)
- bug #072 (tally vs du)
- bug #075 (atomic fs operations)
- update docs to reflect changes


## 2.5.0
- bug #044 (brp from installed srp)
- bug #032 (no BRP from SRP_CANT_FOOL SRPs)
- bug #040 (standard PREPOSTLIBs)
- bug #013 (prettier output formatting)
- bug #025 (dumping output wraps)
- update docs to reflect changes


## 2.6.0
- add automatic shell deps to installed scripts
- examine portability issues...
    * get rid of ALL os.system() calls.  try replacing them with os.popen()
      or commands.getstatusoutput()
    * external deps (md5sum, tar, bzip2, gzip, info, sh, mkdir, cp)
    * export portability commands to packages (sr.ACOPY, sr.RMKDIR, etc)
    * make new portability commands (sr.BUNTAR, sr.GUNTAR, sr.INSTALL, etc)


## 2.7.0
- new package type: rrp (recursive ruckus package)
    these guys will contain multiple srp's and an order file (similar to the
    'vodka' file that was used by the 'drink' script in early versions of the
    source ruckus linux install disk.  just imagine, gnome-2.2-1.rrp...  how
    simple...  how beautiful...  :-)
    ooh, and don't forget...  source_ruckus_linux-3.0-1.rrp
    *drool*
    ex: foobar-2.0-1.hp-ux.9000-785.rrp
    ex: foobar-2.0-1.linux.i686.rrp
    ex: foobar-2.0-1.src.rrp
    ex: simstim-lsp-1.2-1.src.rrp
- command line option to convert a bunch of srp's and/or brp's into an rrp
- misc cleanup
- update man/info pages


...


## 3.0.0
- nice configure script.  generated Makefile should build srp, build
  srp-x.y.z-1.srp, and install itself accordingly  (maybe)
- enforce the use of exported portability commands in NOTES files by setting
  PATH="" (maybe...  this is probalby a bad idea...)
- pre-install, post-install, pre-uninstall, post-uninstall (see bug #005)
- maybe use cpickle for logfiles?  hmm... could be interesting (probably not)
- package dependencies for srp
- package dependencies for brp
- having srp create an rrp no longer requires a LIST...  should automatically
  generate one according to package dependencies
- allow more than one package on command line.  (essentially convert the
  packages into an rrp on the fly...)
- revamp man/info pages with all the new features
