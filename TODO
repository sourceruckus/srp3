* move functions from bootstrap-early in here
Clean them up and make them available to build scripts

*NOTE:* I think this is done, but should probably test a bit more...

* hardcoded path to db file in srp.db

* cli additions [2/5]
  - [X] --src= (tar or dir)
  - [X] --copysrc
  - [ ] --compressor=[gzip,bz2,lzma]
  - [ ] --compression-level=N
  - [ ] --root flag (instead of DESTDIR or SRP_ROOT_PREFIX)

  - [ ] core
  - [ ] size
  - [ ] upgrade
  - [ ] user
  - [ ] ldupdate
  - [ ] ldpath

* upgrade logic

* uninstall

* exception handling clean up
** should we do this:

*NOTE:* this one prints a good error message including the exception details,
        then prints a traceback when exception is re-raised

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
try:
    blarg
except Exception as e:
    print("bad things:", e)
    raise
#+END_EXAMPLE

** or this:

*NOTE:* this one chains the exceptions together... which i don't really like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
try:
    blarg
except Exception:
    raise Exception("bad things")
#+END_EXAMPLE


#  LocalWords:  flyspell cli srcdir gzip bz lzma ldupdate ldpath uninstall srp
#  LocalWords:  blarg hardcoded
