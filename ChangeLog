2007-02-14: summary of changes from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0
--------------------------------------------------
	- squashed bug #083 (brp prepost exceptions)
	- squashed bug #087 (DEVDATE multiple expansion)
	- squashed bug #085 (Makefile.common)
	- squashed bug #086 (foo dist target should be dist-brp)
	- squashed bug #017 (sr.exec_path)
	- squashed bug #088 (dist-* target deps)
	- squashed bug #084 (SRP_CHAIN)
	- squashed bug #089 (SRP_{,NO_}LEFTOVERS)
	
	Fixing bug #085 introduces SRP's Makefile.common.  This makefile can
	be used by package maintainers to consistently create
	foo-x.y.z.tar.bz2, foo-x.y.z-r.srp, and foo-x.y.z-r.platform.id.brp
	targets.  See Info files and example packages for instructions.
	
	Fixing bug #084 introduces a new srp_flag: SRP_CHAIN.  This flag can
	be used to generate multiple BRPs (or installed packages) from a
	single SRP.  For example, building the foo-1.0-1.srp package would
	result in three stand-alone BRPs: foo-1.0-1.linux.i686.brp,
	foo-dev-1.0-1.linux.i686.brp, and foo-docs-1.0-1.linux.i686.brp.
	The flag should have the next package's NOTES file's name attached
	as an argument.
	
	Fixing bug #089 introduces two new flags: SRP_LEFTOVERS and
	SRP_NO_LEFTOVERS.  SRP_LEFTOVERS is now a member of default_flags
	and is the traditional behavior when upgrading (left-over files
	remain behind as a special package).  To turn off this behavior, a
	package can use the SRP_NO_LEFTOVERS flag to force SRP to remove all
	traces of the old package when upgrading.


2006-07-22: summary of changes from 2.2.6 to 2.3.0
--------------------------------------------------
	- squashed bug #057 (srp -F exit status)
	- squashed bug #056 (source tree reorg)
	- squashed bug #058 (bad os.path.join() usage)
	- squashed bug #051 (SHA1 checksums)
	- squashed bug #061 (srp -F umask)
	- squashed bug #052 (tracking installed file's permisions)
	- squashed bug #053 (tracking installed symlink's target)
	- squashed bug #059 (use tarfile module)
	- squashed bug #067 (escape-out hell)
	- squashed bug #039 (SRP_OWNEROVERRIDE)
	- squashed bug #062 (SRP_OWNEROVERRIDE)
	- squashed bug #066 (BRP ldconfig)
	- squashed bug #073 (installing BRP with unsupported srp_flags)
	- squashed bug #074 (abundant srpbak files)
	- squashed bug #076 (PREPOSTLIB exceptions)
	- squashed bug #077 (missing PREPOSTLIB after upgrade)
	- squashed bug #078 (better check() feedback)
	- squashed bug #071 (intermediate dir mode)
	- squashed bug #083 (srp -l exit status)
	- squashed bug #064 (improved deps checking)
	- squashed bug #063 (install distro docs)

	Fixing bug #067 is more major than a simple bugfix in that it
	effects compatibility with pre-existing packages' NOTES files.  It
	is no longer necesary to escape out shell variables or carriage
	returns in the i_script portion of the file.

	Fixing bugs #051, #052, #053, and #039 introduces some new srp_flags.
	- SRP_SHA1SUM
		Forces use of SHA1 checksums
	- SRP_CHECKSUM
		Lets srp decide on a checksum algorithm depending on
		system availability. SRP_MD5SUM or SRP_SHA1SUM is written
		into BRPs.
	- SRP_PERMS
		Causes srp to track installed files' permissions and
		ownership.
	- SRP_LINKTARGET
		Causes srp to track installed symlinks' targets.
	- SRP_OWNEROVERRIDE
		Causes srp to override file ownership at install time by
		looking at a supplied file.  This allows the building of
		BRPs from SRPs that need to chown files as non-root users.
		Using chown inside the NOTES file is now highly frowned
		upon.  Using chmod inside the NOTES file is still
		desirable, though.

	Fixing bug #060 introduces a set of default srp_flags for SRPs.
	Unless specified otherwise in the NOTES file, all SRPs will build
	with the following flags enabled:
	- SRP_UPGRADABLE
	- SRP_CHECKSUM
	- SRP_PERMS
	- SRP_LINKTARGET
	This also causes the addition of the following self explanitory
	(and probably rarely used) srp_flags:
	- SRP_NO_UPGRADE
	- SRP_NO_CHECKSUM
	- SRP_NO_PERMS
	- SRP_NO_LINKTARGET

	Fixing bug #076 means that the new prefered method of failure
	notification in PREPOSTLIB functions is via exceptions.  Integer
	return values will still be checked (for now!) for backwards
	compatibility, but package maintainers should start using
	exceptions sooner rather than later.
