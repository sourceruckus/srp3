next bug will be #090
---------------------


#013:	2003-10-01
	If output is redirected, some lines don't show up at all...
	NOTES:	2003-10-06
		actually, the lines were just out of order.  this turned out
		to be because a few lines were in fact being printed by
		programs called by srp, not srp itself.  apparently, output
		redirection doesn't like that...  so, i fixed the fixable
		occurrences of this.  not sure if we really can fix all of
		them, though.  for example, srp -i will fire off an
		installation script whose output will always get listed
		seperately from the main programs' output if we redirect at
		all...  odd and annoying, but possibly not fixable.
	NOTES:	2003-10-07
		well, i should be able to redirect output/error from scripts
		to a logfile and then (maybe) display that.  this would give
		us a cleaner looking install and would solve the out of
		place output on redirection issue...
	NOTES:	2003-10-23
		when i figure out how to rewind stdout to display some kind
		of spinng progress notification i will start redirecting all
		build output to a file.  the file will be removed if the
		build is successful, but will remain for debugging if
		building fails.
	NOTES:	2005-10-24
		this will be accomplished with worker.py and status.py.
		we'll have ugly work in a seperate thread with a spinner or
		progress bar in the main thread for install, build, check,
		and uninstall.


#023:	2004-02-27
	installing a brp, which knows how big the installation will be,
	should check for available diskspace...  don't forget to check
	/usr/src/ruckus/* for enough room...
	NOTES:	2004-03-01
		actually, srp *doesn't* know the size of a brp
		installation...  it only knows the size of the srpblob,
		which is compressed.  might possibly add something into the
		build code to track size, but not now.
	NOTES:	2005-10-24
		actuall, srp _CAN_ determine how much disk space is needed
		by examining the srpblob with python's tarfile module.


#025:	2004-03-01
	dumping: ############ sometimes gets out of wack and wraps over a
	few lines...  i probably won't bother fixing this untill i change
	the ouput methods to fix bug #013.


#032	2004-03-14
	so, now that SRP_CANT_FOOL is fixed...  we can't build brps.  *sigh*
	i'll have to do the RUCKUS/tmp build to get the file list, but i'm
	not 100% sure what to do after that.  here are the possibilities i'm
	considering:
	#1:
	  - RUCKUS/tmp build for file list
	  - cleanup
	  - real build
	  - go grab all the files that got installed and tar them up
	  - remove installed files
	#2:
	  - RUCKUS/tmp build for file list
	  - cleanup
	  - real build BUT DON'T INSTALL
	  - using the list of files, force the install to happen in
	    RUCKUS/tmp by hand.
	  - tar up RUCKUS/tmp for the brp
	i like #2 because it doesn't write anything in the real world...
	but...  how can i do the build without the install?  that's all
	taken care of by the install script in the NOTES file...  for now, i
	will just not let the user build a brp from a non-foolable srp.
	NOTES:	2005-03-09
		how about this:
		  - SRP_ROOT_PREFIX build
	NOTES:	2005-03-10
		no, that doesn't work... because the package isn't
		foolable.  the binaries would have SRP_ROOT_PREFIX/PATH
		hardcoded in them if we did this, which is just as bad as
		RUCKUS/PATH being in there...


#036	2005-03-09
	read_ldpath() just looks at /etc/ld.so.conf...  that file can have
	extra include statements in it.  on fedora core 3, there's a
	'include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf' line that we parse incorrectly.  this
	will lead to incorrectly failed deps.
	NOTES:	2006-05-03
		fixing bug #064 means this bug only shows its face when we
		can't use the dl module (SRP_ROOT_PREFIX, unsupported
		platforms).


#040	2005-03-10
	this one's more of a feature request than a bug...  how about taking
	some of the commonly used PREPOSTLIBs and making some srp_flags for
	them?  like SRP_SERVICE=atm or SRP_SYMLINKDIR=/opt/ACE+TAO or
	SRP_PERLMODULE=GD?
	NOTES:	2005-03-11
		actually, this would have to be a python module that gets
		imported by the user's PREPOSTLIB because some of these are
		going to take a few arguments...  the list so far is:
		- common_prepost.service
		- common_prepost.user
		- common_prepost.symlinkdir
		- common_prepost.perlmod


#044	2005-06-29
	should be able to build a brp from an installed package.  we can't
	do this right now because we don't keep all the extra peices of the
	srp.  We would need any DEPS files, NOTES, PREPOSTLIB, FILES
	NOTES:	2005-07-13
		planning on replacing sr_package2 with a couple different
		libraries.  one of these is sr_db, which implements a plain
		text filesystem-based database for storing installed package
		information.  as soon as this is in place, this bug will be
		a simple fix.


#060	2005-09-24
	make a default set of srp_flags (SRP_CHECKSUM, SRP_PERMS,
	SRP_LINKTARGET, SRP_UPGRADABLE).  will need to also add a
	SRP_NOT_UPGRADABLE flag.
	FIX:	


#065	2005-10-01
	we're checksumming info's special "dir" file...  which
	changes during installation.  we probably shouldn't be logging
	this file at all...


#068	2005-10-22
	forced cleanup after a failure while building/installing SRPs with
	SRP_INPLACE results in leaving the actual SRP_INPLACE dir.  this
	direcotry should be removed (unless it's in sr.perm_dirs), which is
	how cleanup works if the build/install had been successful.
	NOTES:	2005-10-22
		actually, cleanup after a successful build only removes
		basename(inplace).


#069	2005-10-24
	might be using chown instead of lchown on symlinks...  look into it!


#072	2005-11-08
	srp -c --tally is reporting a different installed size than what's
	returned by du -hsc.


#075	2005-11-10
	srp -i --upgrade should be atomic.  right now, behavior is quite
	undefined if upgrading fails...  should try to make dump() atomic as
	well... not sure how we'll do that, though.


#079	2005-11-21
	upgrading a package with a prepostlib ends up with upgrade leftovers
	containing the prepostlib of the old package.
	NOTES:	2005-11-24
		was definately seeing this at work...  but i can't reproduce
		it.


#080	2005-11-21
	pre/post-uninstall scripts are not getting executed.  this is
	definately true for SRPs, need to find out if BRPs are working.
	NOTES:	2005-11-24
		as with bug #079, this mysterious bug from work is
		unreproducible using the example foo packages.


#081	2005-11-21
	java oddness.  if installed as SRP, end up with the following
	missing files:
	  - /opt/jdk1.5.0_04/demo/applets/Blink/Blink$1.class
	  - /opt/jdk1.5.0_04/demo/plugin/applets/Blink/Blink$1.class
	and if installed as BRP, you get strage dependency problems as well.
