The Source Ruckus Packager
(c) 2001-2006 Michael D Labriola <mdlabriola@yahoo.com>


The Source Ruckus Packger (SRP) is a lightweight package manager written in
Python.  It aims to create an easy to use and maintain system for managing
software packages across multiple platforms.  This is done by using
source-based packages that get compiled at install time.  The speed trade off
of compiling everything at install time is easily made up for by the ability to
maintain a single cross-platform package.


SRP is written in Python, so it should be relatively easy to port to other *nix
systems.

Requires:
  Python >= 2.3
