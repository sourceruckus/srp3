The Source Ruckus Packager
(c) 2001-2016 Michael D Labriola <michael.d.labriola@gmail.com>


The Source Ruckus Packager (SRP) is a lightweight, yet full-featured package
manager.  Same general idea as other package management systems (e.g., RPM,
DEB), just done differently.  The target audience for this packager is not
the big-time distro developers, but rather the small guy rolling his own at
home (or small office).

SRP is written in Python, so it should be relatively easy to port to other *nix
systems.

Requires:
  Python >= 3.2
