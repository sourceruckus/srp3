# FIXME: should we compress the whole srp file?  or just the blob to be
#        installed (old behavior)?

# FIXME: srp should add the following things when it creates the brp:
#
#        header:blob_compression: none, gz, bz2, lz
#

[prereqs]
# these specificy the minimum version of srp require to build this package
version_major = 3
version_minor = 0
version_bugfix = 0
# this is so we can require specific features

# FIXME: we can embed actual python lists in here and then run them trough
#        eval()... or we can just keep this as a space delimited list...

# FIXME: for starters, all the stuff below this comment is commented out.  this
#        is so i can test python3's configparser, which doesn't like the
#        %%BUFFER stuff.  we'll probably end up stripping non-ini format
#        sections from the NOTES file and then pass a filebuf into configparser
#        to parse the rest of the key/value pairs
#
# FIXME: alternatively, we could stick base64 encoding txt in here... see
#        test.py...
