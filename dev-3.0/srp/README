goals:

- non-write ops (creating package instances) shouldn't write in RUCKUS.
  either write in a /tmp dir or parse through the tarball without extracting
  anywhere.

- clean, modular, object oriented design.  use new-style classes possibly
  also using metaclasses and function decorators.

- support for multiple (in the future) versions of packages (built from
  different versions of srp, that is).

- new, chainable NOTES file (ex: foo.srp builds into foo.brp, foo-doc.brp,
  and foo-dev.brp)

- cleaner output handling, especially when debugging

- tkinter front-end (maybe)

- implement BRPs as pickled SRPs

- change BRP's hosttype to be a little more useful (fc5.i686, rh7.i686,
  hpux10.risc, sol8.sparc, win98.i686, unix.i386, etc)

- add lots more SRP flags (SRP_PERLMOD, SRP_USER, SRP_SERVICE,
  SRP_REVERT, SRP_REPAIRABLE, etc)
